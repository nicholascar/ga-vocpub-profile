# GA's Vocabulary Publication Profile
This is a *profile* of the [Vocabulary Publication Profile](https://w3id.org/profile/vocpub) which is, in turn, a *profile* of the [Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS)](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/) data model used to model vocabularies (controled lists; taxonomies). This particular *profile* is implemented by [Geoscience Australia](https://www.ga.gov.au) to allow for the validation of vocabularies according to their business needs. This profile adds a few, minor, rules on top of what VocPub already imposes.

By *profile*, what is meant here is "A specification that constrains, extends, combines, or provides guidance or explanation about the usage of other specifications." (from [PROF](https://www.w3.org/TR/dx-prof/#definitions)) and, here the *other specifications* are VocPub and SKOS.

This profile is formulated according to the [Profiles Vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/dx-prof/) and provides [Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL)](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) validator files that can be used to determine whether vocabularies conform to this profile.

This profile is hosted online in [Linked Data](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data) form at an Australian-government issued persistent web address:
